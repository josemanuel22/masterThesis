# Master Thesis.
 My Master's thesis on Bounded Variation Functions and the Mumford-Shah Functional.
 
# Abstract.
Functions of bounded variation were introduced by C. Jordan in connexion with Dirichlet's test for the convergence of Fourier series. However, the modern definition of functions of bounded variation (BV functions in the sequel) is due to the works of E. De Giorgi, who introduced the class of functions whose distributional derivatives are measures. Today, the class of BV functions presents a major role in several classical problems of the calculus of variations.

In the first chapter, we will review some preliminary results of the abstract measure theory and of the geometric measure theory. The second chapter is entirely devoted to the study of BV functions and the closely related theory of sets of finite perimeter. In this regard, we will define and study fine properties of the space of BV functions and will examine the link between sets of finite perimeter and BV functions. The next chapter of the thesis is devoted to special functions of bounded variation (SBV functions) and to the properties of this functional space. Thanks to the preliminary work, the last chapter of the thesis will be oriented towards the study of specific variational problems on the unitary framework built previously. E. De Giorgi, coined the term "free discontinuity problems" to refer to a class of minimum problems characterised by a competition between volume energies, concentrated on N-dimensional sets, and surface energies, concentrated on (N-1)-dimensional sets. Another feature of these problems is the fact that the supports of the surface energy are not fixed a priori, and are, in many cases, the relevant unknow of the problem. The best-known example of free discontinuity problem was proposed by D. Mumford and J. Shah. The final goal of the thesis will be to prove that the classical formulation of the Mumford-Shah problem and the weak one in the SBV are indeed equivalent in any space dimension.
